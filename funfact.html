      Hi! Here are some fun facts about me:
      <br>
      <br>
     1.  When I was around 3 years old, we found out that I had hearing loss. I got my first pair of hearing aids a few months later, and have been wearing them since then. 
     <br>
     <br>
     2. I have never broken a bone before! 
     <br>
     <br>
     3. I have 2 dogs: I have a husky, and a lab-boxer mix. 
     <br>
     <br>
     4. I have a very big family (including cousins). 
     <br>
